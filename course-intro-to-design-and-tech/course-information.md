## Basic Principle of User Centered Design

### What is Design?

Design is the process of creating solutions to problems or opportunities through the intentional arrangement of elements or components, often to improve functionality, usability, or aesthetics. It can be applied to various fields and contexts, including product design, graphic design, web design, architecture, and more. 

The design process typically involves research, ideation, prototyping, and testing and requires a combination of creativity, analytical thinking, and technical skills. 

The ultimate goal of design is to create useful, usable, and desirable solutions for the intended users or audience.

### Design Thinking

Design thinking is a problem-solving approach emphasizing empathy, creativity, and iteration to develop innovative solutions to complex problems. It is a human-centered approach that seeks to understand the needs and perspectives of the people who will use a product or service and then uses that understanding to guide the design process.

Design thinking typically involves several stages, including defining the problem, researching and empathizing with users, ideating and brainstorming potential solutions, prototyping and testing those solutions, and iterating on them based on feedback.

Design thinking is not limited to designers and can be applied in various contexts, including business, education, healthcare, and government. It is a flexible and iterative approach that encourages experimentation and creativity and can lead to breakthrough solutions that might not have been possible through more traditional problem-solving methods.

### Empathy

Empathy, as it relates to design thinking, is the ability to understand and share the feelings, experiences, and perspectives of others, particularly the people who will use a product or service. It is a critical aspect of the human-centered design process, as it helps designers identify and address the needs and desires of their target audience.

Empathy in design thinking involves actively listening to and observing users, asking open-ended questions to understand their needs and motivations better, and putting oneself in their shoes to gain a deeper understanding of their experiences. By doing so, designers can gain insights into how users interact with a product or service and use those insights to develop solutions that better meet their needs and desires.

Empathy is not just about understanding the functional needs of users but also their emotional needs and desires. By designing for both functional and emotional needs, designers can create products and services that are useful, usable, engaging, and satisfying for users.

### Ideation

Ideation, as it relates to design thinking, is the process of generating a wide range of possible solutions or ideas to a specific problem or challenge. It is a critical step in the design thinking process, as it allows designers to explore various potential solutions before selecting the most promising ones to develop further.

Ideation in design thinking is typically done in a collaborative and non-judgmental environment, where all ideas are encouraged, and no idea is immediately dismissed. The goal is to generate a large number of ideas in a short amount of time without worrying about their feasibility or practicality at this stage.

Ideation techniques in design thinking may include brainstorming, mind mapping, SCAMPER (Substitute, Combine, Adapt, Modify, Put to Another Use, Eliminate, Reverse) exercises, and more.

Once many ideas have been generated, designers can then evaluate and select the most promising ones to prototype and test to determine which ideas are most likely to address the problem or challenge at hand.

### Prototyping

Prototyping, as it relates to design thinking, is the process of creating a preliminary version of a product or service to test and evaluate its design, functionality, and usability. It is a critical step in the design thinking process. It allows designers to quickly and cheaply test their ideas and gather user feedback before committing to a final design.

Prototyping in design thinking can take many forms, depending on the nature of the product or service being developed. It may involve creating a physical model or mockup, building a digital prototype or wireframe, or even using role-playing or other interactive techniques to simulate the user experience.

The goal of prototyping is not to create a finished product but rather to create a rough and simple version that can be quickly and easily modified based on user feedback. This feedback can then be used to refine and improve the design, leading to a final product or service that is more effective and better suited to the users' needs.

Prototyping in design thinking is an iterative process, with designers creating multiple versions of the prototype and testing each to refine and improve the design. By doing so, designers can create a product or service that is more effective, efficient, and user-friendly and that better meets the needs of its intended audience.

### Testing

Testing, as it relates to design thinking, is the process of evaluating a prototype or early version of a product or service to gather feedback and identify areas for improvement. It is a critical step in the design thinking process, as it allows designers to validate their ideas and ensure that the final product or service meets the needs and expectations of its intended audience.

Testing in design thinking typically involves giving users a prototype or early version of a product or service and observing how they interact with it. This feedback can be gathered through surveys, interviews, or direct observation and is used to identify strengths and weaknesses in the design, as well as to identify potential areas for improvement.

Testing in design thinking is an iterative process, with designers using user feedback to refine and improve the design before trying it again. By doing so, designers can create a product or service that is more effective, efficient, and user-friendly and that better meets the needs of its intended audience.

Testing can also help to identify potential problems or issues with a design before it is released to the broader public, allowing designers to address these issues before they become significant problems. By incorporating testing into the design thinking process, designers can create products and services that are more likely to succeed in the marketplace and better suited to their users' needs.
