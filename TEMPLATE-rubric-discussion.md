## Discussion Rubric Explanation (For Faculty)

This discussion rubric is meant to work with any protocols that you may have regarding discussion board posts (word count, number of replies, required citations, etc.). The protocols should be included by faculty members in the discussion prompt. A link should also be provided to a single instance of this discussion standard. Ideally, there would be one location where the discussion rubric is stored so that any revisions to it may be enacted globally in the source instance.

It is recommended when using this rubric for grading discussion board engagement, that the instructor provides specific feedback that addresses the rubric criteria.
